# The EasyAuth Project 
EasyAuth is an open-source authentication system designed to provide secure and easy-to-use authentication services for web applications. It supports various authentication methods, including OAuth(coming soon), JWT, and email verification, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with EasyAuth, you can use the EasyAuth SDK for quick integration into your web application. The SDK provides a simple interface for authentication operations such as login, registration, and session management and many more. You can learn more about SDK and Server from the [EasyAuth Documentation website (coming soon)]().
